# Selected Days

You can initialize the calendar with day/days already selected.

## Usage

```js
new HelloWeek({
    selector: '.calendar',
    daysSelected: ['2020-01-10', '2020-02-12', '2020-12-13', '2020-12-25'],
    multiplePick: true,
});
```

> You have multiple days selected, also need to have the option `multiplePick: true`.
